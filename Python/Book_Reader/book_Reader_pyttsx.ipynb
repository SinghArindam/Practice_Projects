      "THOUGHT AND CHARACTER\n",
      "THE aphorism, \"As a man thinketh in his heart so is he,\" not only\n",
      "embraces the whole of a man's being, but is so comprehensive  as to reach\n",
      "out to every condition and circumstance of his life. A man is literally what\n",
      "he thinks,  his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.\n",
      "As the plant springs from, and could not be without, the seed, so every\n",
      "act of a man springs from the hidden seeds of thought, and could not have\n",
      "appeared without them. This applies equally to those acts called\n",
      "\"spontaneous\" and \"unpremeditated\" as to those, which are deliberately\n",
      "executed.\n",
      "Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits; thus\n",
      "does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own husbandry .\n",
      "\"Thought in the mind hath made us, What we are  \n",
      "By thought was wrought and built. If a man's mind  \n",
      "Hath evil thoughts, pain comes on him as comes  \n",
      "The wheel the ox behind....\n",
      "..If one endure  \n",
      "In purity of thought, joy follows him  \n",
      "As his own shadow—sure.\"  \n",
      "Man is a growth by law, and not a creation by artifice, and cause and\n",
      "effect is as absol ute and undeviating in the hidden realm of thought as in the\n",
      "world of visible and material things. A noble and Godlike character is not a\n",
      "thing of favour or chance, but is the natural result of continued effort in\n",
      "right thinking, the effect of long-cherished association with Godlikethoughts. An ignoble and bestial  character , by the same process,  is the result\n",
      "of the continued harbouring of grovelling thoughts.\n",
      "Man is made or unmade by himself; in the armoury of thought he forges\n",
      "the weapons by which he destroys himself; he also fashions the tools with\n",
      "which he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy and strength and\n",
      "peace. By the right choice and true application of thought, man ascends to\n",
      "the Divine Perfection; by the abuse and wrong application of thought, he\n",
      "descends below the level of the beast. Between these two extremes are all\n",
      "the grades of character , and man is their maker and master .\n",
      "Of all the beautiful truths pertaining to the soul which have been restored\n",
      "and brought to light in this age, none is more gladdening or fruitful of\n",
      "divine promise and confidence than this—that man is the master  of thought,\n",
      "the moulder of character , and the maker and shaper of condition,\n",
      "environment, and destiny .\n",
      "As a being of Power , Intelligence, and Love, and the lord of his own\n",
      "thoughts, man holds the key to every situation, and contains within himself\n",
      "that transforming and regenerat ive agency by which he may make himself\n",
      "what he wills.\n",
      "Man is always the master , even in his weaker and most abandon ed state;\n",
      "but in his weakness and degradation he is the foolish master who\n",
      "misgoverns his \"household.\" When he begins to reflect upon his condition,\n",
      "and to search diligently for the Law upon which his being is established, he\n",
      "then becomes the wise master , directing his energies with intelligence, and\n",
      "fashioning his thoughts to fruitful issues. Such is the conscious  master , and\n",
      "man can only thus become by discovering within himself  the laws of\n",
      "thought; which discovery is totally a matter of application, self analysis, and\n",
      "experience.\n",
      "Only by much searching and mining, are gold and diamonds obtained,\n",
      "and man can find every truth connected with his being, if he will dig deep\n",
      "into the mine of his soul; and that he is the maker of his character , the\n",
      "moulder of his life, and the builder of his destiny , he may unerringly prove,\n",
      "if he will watch, control, and alter his thoughts, tracing their effects upon\n",
      "himself, upon others, and upon his life and circumstances, linking cause andeffect by patient practice and investigation, and utilizing  his every\n",
      "experience, even  to the most trivial, everyday occurrence, as a means of\n",
      "obtaining that knowledge of himself which is Understanding, Wisdom,\n",
      "Power . In this direction, as in no other , is the law absolute that \"He that\n",
      "seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;\" for only by\n",
      "patience, practic e, and ceaseless importunity can a man enter the Door of\n",

      "EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON CIRCUMST ANCES\n",
      "MAN'S mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently\n",
      "cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or neglected, it\n",
      "must, and will, bring forth.  If no useful seeds are put into it, then an\n",
      "abundance of useless weed-see ds will fall therein, and will continue to\n",
      "produce their kind.\n",
      "Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds, and\n",
      "growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man tend the\n",
      "garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and impure\n",
      "thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and fruits of right,\n",
      "useful, and pure thoughts. By pursuing this process, a man sooner or later\n",
      "discovers that he is the master -gardener of his soul, the director of his life.\n",
      "He also reveals, within himself,  the laws of thought, and understands, with\n",
      "ever-increasing accuracy , how the thought-forces and mind elements\n",
      "operate in the shaping of his character , circumstances, and destiny .\n",
      "Thought and character are one, and as character can only manifest and\n",
      "discover itself through environment and circumstance, the outer conditions\n",
      "of a person's life will always be found to be harmoniously related to his\n",
      "inner state. This does not mean that a man's circumstances at any given time\n",
      "are an indication  of his entire characte r, but that those circum stances are sointimately connected with some vital thought-element within himself that,\n",
      "for the time being, they are indispensable to his development.\n",
      "Every man is where he is by the law of his being; the thoughts which he\n",
      "has built into his character have brought him there, and in the arrangement\n",
      "of his life there is no element of chance, but all is the result of a law which\n",
      "cannot err. This is just as true of those who feel \"out of harmony\" with their\n",
      "surroundings as of those who are contented with them.\n",
      "As a progressive and evolving being, man is where he is that he may\n",
      "learn that he may grow; and as he learns the spiritual lesson which any\n",
      "circumstance contains for him, it passes away and gives place to other\n",
      "circumstances.\n",
      "Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to be\n",
      "the creat ure of outside condition s, but when he realizes that he is a creative\n",
      "power , and that he may comman d the hidden soil and seeds of his being out\n",
      "of which circumstances grow , he then becomes the rightfu l master of\n",
      "himself.\n",
      "That circumstances grow out of thought every man knows who has for\n",
      "any length of time practised self-control and self-purification, for he will\n",
      "have noticed that the alteration in his circumstances has been in exact ratio\n",
      "with his altered mental condition. So true is this that when a man earnestly\n",
      "applies himself to remedy the defects in his character , and makes swift and\n",
      "marked progress, he passes rapidly through a succession of vicissitudes.\n",
      "The soul attracts  that which it secretly harbours; that which it loves, and\n",
      "also that which it fears; it reaches the height of its cherished aspirations; it\n",
      "falls to the level of its unchastened desires,—and circumstan ces are the\n",
      "means by which the soul receives its own.\n",
      "Every thought-seed sown or allowed to fall into the mind, and to take\n",
      "root there, produces its own, blossoming sooner or later into act, and\n",
      "bearing its own fruitage of opportunity and circumstance. Good thoughts\n",
      "bear good fruit, bad thoughts bad fruit.The outer world of circumstance shapes itself to the inner world of\n",
      "thought, and both pleasant and unpleasant external conditions are factors,\n",
      "which make for the ultimate good of the individual. As the reaper of his\n",
      "own harvest, man learns both by suf fering and bliss.\n",
      "Following the inmost desires, aspirations, thoughts, by which he allows\n",

      "justly earns. His wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when\n",
      "they harmonize with his thoughts and actions.In the light of this truth, what, then, is the meaning of \"fighting against\n",
      "circumstances?\" It means that a man is continually revolting against an\n",
      "effect  without, while all the time he is nourishing and preserving its cause  in\n",
      "his heart. That cause may take the form of a conscious vice or an\n",
      "unconscious weakness; but whatever it is, it stubbornly retards the efforts of\n",
      "its possessor , and thus calls aloud for remedy .\n",
      "Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to\n",
      "improve themselves; they therefore remain bound. The man who does not\n",
      "shrink from self-crucifixion can never fail to accomplish the object upon\n",
      "which his heart is set. This is as true of earthly as of heavenly things. Even\n",
      "the man whose sole object is to acquire wealth must be prepared to make\n",
      "great personal sacrifices before  he can accomplish his object; and how\n",
      "much more so he who would realize a strong and well-poised life?\n",
      "Here is a man who is wretchedly poor. He is extremely anxiou s that his\n",
      "surroundings and home comfor ts should be improved, yet all the time he\n",
      "shirks his work, and consider s he is justified in trying to deceive his\n",
      "employer on the ground of the insuf ficiency of his wages. Such a man does\n",
      "not understand the simplest rudiments of those principles which are the\n",
      "basis of true prosperity , and is not only totally unfitted to rise out of his\n",
      "wretchedness, but is actually attracting to himself a still deeper\n",
      "wretchedness by dwelling in, and acting out, indolent, deceptive, and\n",
      "unmanly thoughts.\n",
      "Here is a rich man who is the victim of a painful and persisten t disease\n",
      "as the result of gluttony . He is willing to give lar ge sums of money to get rid\n",
      "of it, but he will not sacrifice his gluttonous desires. He wants to gratify his\n",
      "taste for rich and unnatural viands and have his health as well. Such a man\n",
      "is totally unfit to have health,  because he has not yet learned the first\n",
      "principles of a healthy life.\n",
      "Here is an employer of labour who adopts crooked measures to avoid\n",
      "paying the regulation wage, and, in the hope of making larger profits,\n",
      "reduces the wages of his workpeople. Such a man is altogether unfitted for\n",
      "prosperity , and when he finds himself bankrupt, both as regards reputation\n",
      "and riches, he blames circumstances, not knowing that he is the sole author\n",
      "of his condition.I have introduced these three cases merely as illustrative of the truth that\n",
      "man is the causer (though nearly always is unconsciously) of his\n",
      "circumstances, and that, whilst  aiming at a good end, he is continually\n",
      "frustrating its accomplishment by encouraging thoughts and desires which\n",
      "cannot possibly harmonize with that end. Such cases could be multiplied\n",
      "and varied almost indefinitely , but this is not necessary , as the reader can, if\n",
      "he so resolves, trace the action of the laws of thought in his own mind and\n",
      "life, and until this is done, mere external facts cannot serve as a ground of\n",
      "reasoning.\n",
      "Circumstances, however , are so complicated, thought is so deeply\n",
      "rooted, and the conditions of happiness vary so, vastly with individuals, that\n",
      "a man's entire soul-condition (although it may be known to himself) cannot\n",
      "be judged by another from the external aspect of his life alone. A man may\n",
      "be honest in certain directions, yet suffer privations; a man may be\n",
      "dishonest in certain directions, yet acquire wealth; but the conclusion\n",
      "usually formed that the one man fails because of his particular honesty , and\n",
      "that the other prospers because of his particular dishonesty , is the result of a\n",
      "superficial judgment, which assumes that the dishonest man is almost\n",
      "totally corrupt, and the honest man almost entirely virtuous. In the light of a\n",
      "deeper knowledge and wider experience such judgment is found to be\n",
      "erroneous. The dishonest man may have some admirable virtues, which the\n",
      "other does, not possess; and the honest man obnoxious vices which are\n",
      "absent in the other . The honest  man reaps the good results of his honest\n",
